# Coding for My Sister

An introduction to coding for my sister (and anyone else).

## Prerequisites
Before you start make sure you have the following bases covered:

- You have a favourite text editor, I recommend [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com) or [Brackets](http://brackets.io)
- You have [git](http://git-scm.org) [installed](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
- You have your favourite web browser open

Once you're cool with that then start off at [Chapter 1's Hello World](chapter-1/hello-world/).

## Index
- [**Chapter 1 â€“ Getting Started**](chapter-1)
	- [Hello World](chapter-1/hello-world/): we create a simple HTML page, use git to version it and deploy it online on to github.com's `gh-pages`

## Errata or Suggestions

Fork the repo, make the desired update and submit a pull request.
