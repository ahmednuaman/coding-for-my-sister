# 1.2 Typography

So we're going to continue off from where [Hello World](chapter-1/hello-world/) left off and talk about text. I'm not going to go into [every single text based tag in HTML](http://baselinecss.com/typography.html), but instead I'll cover the basics:

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Quotes
- Lists

## Headings

1. let's begin by opening the `index.html` file and we're going to change our text `Hello World and Hello Mum!` into a heading; to do this we need to *wrap* a heading tag around our text, so let's begin by adding the start of the heading tag before our text, so write `<h1>` at the start of that line
2. now we need to close the tag to complete the *wrapping* so we write `</h1>` (the closing tag), at the end of the line
3. save the file and open it in your favourite web browser and you should see something like [this](http://ahmednuaman.github.io/coding-for-my-sister/chapter-1/typography/headings.html)
